	Proposition:
		S(n) implies 3|n, for all nonnegative integers of n
			S(n) := exactly n¢ postage can be assembled from only 6¢ and 15¢ stamps 
			j|k := j is a divisor of k
	
	Proof:
		Let C be the set of counterexamples, namely:
			C := {n ∤ 6ᵃ + 15ᵇ} where a, b are nonnegative integers
		Assume for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that
