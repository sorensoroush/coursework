	Proposition:
		S(n) implies 3|n, for all nonnegative integers of n
			S(n) := exactly n¢ postage can be assembled from only 6¢ and 15¢ stamps 
			j|k := j is a divisor of k
	
	Proof:
		Let C be the set of counterexamples, namely:
			C := {n ∤ 6a + 15b} where a, b are nonnegative integers
		Assume for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that C is nonempty. Then by the Well Ordering Principle, there is a smallest number, m ∈ C. This m must be positive because:
			n, the variable element of C, is established to be a nonnegative integer
			Thus, C is a set of nonnegative integers
		But if S(m) holds and m is positive, then S(m-6) or S(m-15) must hold, because:
			subtracting by 6 or 15 still fits the definition of C by decrementing a or b by 1
		So suppose S(m-6) holds. Then 3|(m-6), because:
