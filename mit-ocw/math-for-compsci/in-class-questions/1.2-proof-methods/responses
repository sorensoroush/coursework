1. 
	Proposition:
		If (a · b = n), then either a or b must be ≤ √n, where a, b, and n, are nonnegative numbers
	
	Proof:
		We use proof by contradiction
		Suppose if (a · b = n), then neither a nor b must be ≤ √n, where a, b, and n, are nonnegative numbers
		The law of trichotomy, when applied to relations of numbers, states that any pair of real values x and y can have only one of three relations: x > y, x = y, or x < y
		We can rewrite this supposition using the law of trichotomy: if (a, b ≮ √n) and (a, b ≠ √n); then (a, b > √n)
		We can multiply (a > √n) and (b > √n) to yield (a · b > n)
		This conclusion contradicts the antecedent, which means the proposition must be true

	Proposition:
		For any nonnegative imperfect square x, √x is irrational
	
	Proof:
		This proof is done by contradiction
		Suppose √x is rational
		The definition of a rational number is a number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers
		Therefore √x can be written as fraction ⁿ⁄ₘ expressed in lowest terms, where n and m are integers:
		(1)		√x = ⁿ⁄ₘ
		Square both sides of (1) to yield:
		(2)		x = n²/m²
		(3) 	x · m² = n²
		This implies x is a factor of n


3.
	Proposition: 
		An irrational number raised to a irrational power can be rational
	
	Scratchwork:
		...I'm stumped on this one (unfortunately writing this after looking this concept up online)
		It says to consider √2^√2
		...how do I even do that?
		None of the laws of exponents helps with this
		After having looked it up online, it can't be solved algebraically...needs to be solved as an appoximation
		Then I'm confused about how it can be rational...
		I'm beginning to think this is a dummy question meant to confuse students
		How can I even solve by cases for something I can't analyze?
		I read that it can be solved using logarithms...
		So in this case:
			x = √2^√2 
			log√2(x) = √2 
		...yep, stumped

	Proof:
		[omitted]


4.
	Proposition:
		2log₂3 is irrational
	
	Scratchwork:
		We can prove this with the same method as exercise 2

	Proof:
		This proof is done by contradiction
		Suppose 2log₂3 is rational

		The definition of a rational number is a number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers
		Therefore 2log₂3 can be written as fraction ⁿ⁄ₘ expressed in lowest terms, where n and m are integers:
		(1) 2log₂3 = ⁿ⁄ₘ  

		Rewrite using the power rule of logarithms:
		(2) log₂9 = ⁿ⁄ₘ

		Rewrite using the definition of logarithms:
		(3) 2^(ⁿ⁄ₘ) = 9
		
		(4) ᵐ√(2ⁿ) = 9

		{I don't know, to be continued?}
