	Proposition:
		If (a · b = n), then either a or b must be ≤ √n, where a, b, and n, are nonnegative numbers
	
	Proof:
		We use proof by contradiction
		Suppose if (a · b = n), then neither a nor b must be ≤ √n, where a, b, and n, are nonnegative numbers
		The law of trichotomy, when applied to relations of numbers, states that any pair of real values x and y can have only one of three relations: x > y, x = y, or x < y
		We can rewrite this supposition using the law of trichotomy: if (a, b ≮ √n) and (a, b ≠ √n); then (a, b > √n)
		We can multiply (a > √n) and (b > √n) to yield (a · b > n)
		This conclusion contradicts the antecedent, which means the proposition must be true

2.
	Proposition:
		For any nonnegative imperfect square x, √x is irrational
	
	Proof:
		This proof is done by contradiction
		Suppose √x is rational
		The definition of a rational number is a number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers
		Therefore √x can be written as fraction ⁿ⁄ₘ expressed in lowest terms, where n and m are integers:
		(1)		√x = ⁿ⁄ₘ
		Square both sides of (1) to yield:
		(2)		x = n²/m²
		(3) 	x · m² = n²
		This implies x is a factor of n
