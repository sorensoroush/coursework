	Proposition:
		If (a · b = n), then either a or b must be ≤ √n, where a, b, and n, are nonnegative numbers
	
	Proof:
		We use proof by contradiction
		Suppose if (a · b = n), then neither a nor b must be ≤ √n, where a, b, and n, are nonnegative numbers
		We can rewrite this, using the law of trichotomy, to say "both a and b must be > √n"
		Rewritten, a > √n AND b > √n
		We can multiply both inequalities to yield (a · b > n)
		This conclusion contradicts the antecedent, which means the proposition must be true
